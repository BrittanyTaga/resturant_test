    <h1>Resturants around Litchfield Park, AZ</h1>
    <p>Here in Litchfield Park, there are a couple of resturants that I personally enjoy.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
           <a href= "https://www.teabocoffee.com/">Teabo Coffee & Sandwhiches</a> 

            <p>

               </p>
               <p> 
               Teabo Coffee & Sandwhiches was first found due to the boba drinks I was trying to find.

                </p>
                <p>The pizza here is huge and can easily fill my stomach for a week.</p>

                Islands food is a local resturant chain that I grew up with.
                It is a Hawaiin style burger joint with a sports bar.

           <p>
                Have not yet visited but the food presentation looks good and the reviews are good as well.

           <p>
                I have yet to try this resturant as well but I do like the selection.
                With this selection, it is easier to avoid allergies.
                From September 1, 2021, the company has yet to update their website with the Arizona location.
